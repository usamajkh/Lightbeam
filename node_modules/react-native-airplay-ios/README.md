Xcode -> New file -> Swift file -> Create bridging headers

### How to create listeners

```js
import { AirPlayListener, AirPlay } from react-native-airplay-btn

// Setups native listeners which detect audio output route changes
AirPlay.startScan()

this.airPlayConnected = AirPlayListener.addListener('deviceConnected', ({ devices }) => this.setState({
    devices,
})); --> returns a boolean


// Remove Listener in componentWillUnmount
this.deviceConnected.remove();
```

Also you can import ```withAirPlayControl``` hoc and wrap your view component like so:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import { withAirPlayControl } from 'react-native-airplay-ios'

type Device = {
  deviceName: string,
  portName: string,
}

type Props = {
  devices: Device[],
}

// Shows currently connected audio output devices
export const AirPlayDevices = withAirPlayControl(({ devices }: Props) => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center' }}>
    {devices.map((device) => (
      <Text>
        {device.deviceName} {device.portName}
      </Text>
    ))}
  </View>
))
```

Devices is an array of objects that contains information about currently connected audio output(s):
```js
[{deviceName: "Some Bluetooth Headphones Model", portType: "BluetoothA2DPOutput"}]
// or
[{deviceName: "Speakers", portType:"Speakers"}]
// or
[{deviceName: "Andreyâ€™s Apple TV", portType: "AirPlay"}]
```

Note:

Probably it could just be an object, but internally AVAudioSessionRouteDescription returns array, so there *might* be a case when there is more than one device connected at the time.

## Methods

```js
  AirPlay.startScan();
  
  AirPlay.disconnect();
```

### Create AirPlay Button

```js
import { AirPlayButton } from 'react-native-airplay-btn';
<AirPlayButton source={{
            disabled:
              '',
            normal:
              '',
            focused:
              '',
            highlighted:
              '',
            selected:
              '',
          }} />
```

Source is optional, as well as the states. You can pass a single state if you want, or don't pass this prop at all.
The string is base64 encoded image.
The size of image is 29x29.
This limitation is due to the fact that AirPlayButton is a native component under the hood. It uses MPVolumeView to show routes button.

Note: The AirPlay Button does not show in the simulator
